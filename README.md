Configuration files for my [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) and [i3](https://i3wm.org/) environment.  
Because I use these on both my laptop and desktop, some configurations like i3 and polybar are separated to avoid having stuff like battery and brightness levels configured to appear on the desktop.
