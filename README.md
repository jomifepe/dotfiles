# dotfiles
Configuration files for my [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)/[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and [i3](https://i3wm.org/) environment.  
Because I use these on both my laptop and desktop, some configurations like i3 and polybar are separated to avoid having stuff like battery and brightness levels configured to appear on the desktop.

## Installation
Firstly, clone this repo to your home folder
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jomifepe/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```
### Full install
```bash
# To install everything, which is not recommended in a configured environment, only on a fresh install
