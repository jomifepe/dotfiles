# dotfiles
Configuration files for my [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and [i3](https://i3wm.org/) environment.  
These directories are organized in a way so that `stow` can make symbolic links to the correct locations on a real installation.

## Installation
Firstly, clone this repo to your home folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jomifepe/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```
### Full install
```bash
# To install everything, which is not recommended in a configured environment, only on a fresh install

make
```
### Personalized install
Just run the shell scripts individually
